This code explores LivWell dataset from the Belmin et al's 2022 Nature paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01824-2">LivWell: a sub-national Dataset on the Living Conditions of Women and their Well-being for 52 Countries</a>. The authors aggregated a longitudinal dataset from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for subnational regions. Much of their work is in geographic harmonization of boundaries.

This code wrangle some of their raw data to look more like their published data set.
